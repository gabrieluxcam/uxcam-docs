So you've got your account set up, now let's make sure your Android app is equipped with the insights that UXCam can provide. This guide will take you through the first steps of integrating UXCam, sending your first session, and setting up key features. Our goal? A successful integration that sets you up for product-led growth, better usability insights, and happier users.

## What Does a Successful Integration Look Like?

1. Basic integration

<br />

### Quick Start: Only a Couple of Lines of Code

Let's get you started with the basics. With just a few lines of code, you'll be on your way to capturing user sessions in your test app.

#### Add dependencies for UXCam Library

Import UXCam using Maven in the **module's build.gradle** file:

```kotlin build.gradle (Java & Kotlin)
repositories {
  maven{ 
     url 'https://sdk.uxcam.com/android/' 
  } 
} 
dependencies { 
     implementation 'com.uxcam:uxcam:3.+' 
}
```

#### Add your UXCam Key to your app

1. Find the UXCam App Key for your app integration - **TODO: Add screenshot of where to find the App Key**

   **Pro tip:** create separate apps keys for your debug and production app in the UXCam dashboard (e.g. 'Your app - debug', 'Your app - production') to keep your data clean.

2. Add UXCAM\_KEY to your local.properties file. local.properties lives in the project root and is already in every default .gitignore, so it never reaches your VCS.
   ```Text local.properties (Java & Kotlin)
   UXCAM_KEY=your_app_key
   ```

3. Load the `UXCAM_KEY` in your build.gradle (or build.gradle.tks) files into your BuildConfig

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL)

val uxcamKey: String = project.findProperty("UXCAM_KEY") as? String ?: ""

android {
    defaultConfig {
        // Same result: BuildConfig.UXCAM_KEY
        buildConfigField("String", "UXCAM_KEY", "\"$uxcamKey\"")
    }
}
```
```groovy
// app/build.gradle (Groovy DSL)

def uxcamKey = project.findProperty("UXCAM_KEY") ?: ""

android {
    defaultConfig {
        // Make the key available as BuildConfig.UXCAM_KEY
        buildConfigField "String", "UXCAM_KEY", "\"${uxcamKey}\""
    }
}
```

<br />

#### Configure and initialise the UXCam SDK

1. Identify where to initialise the UXCam Android SDK

| **If you…**                                                 | **Put`UXCam.startWithConfiguration()` in…**                                              | **Why**                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Have (or can add) a custom **`Application`class**           | `MyApp : Application` → `override fun onCreate()`                                        | Runs before any `Activity`, so the first screen and uncaught crashes are always captured. Recommended for most apps. |
| Don’t have an `Application` class and don’t want to add one | Your **launcher`Activity`** → `onCreate()` (before `setContentView`)                     | Still early enough for the first screen; simplest drop-in as shown in the official quick-start.                      |
| Use a **single-Activity / Jetpack Compose** architecture    | Either of the above (preferred) **or** the top-level `@Composable` that’s first rendered | Works because Compose’s `setContent` is still in the launcher activity’s `onCreate()`.                               |
| Rely on **MultiDex**                                        | Call `MultiDex.install(this)` first, then UXCam, inside `Application.onCreate()`         | Guarantees the secondary dex files are loaded before the SDK.                                                        |

**Rule of thumb:** *Start the SDK once, at the earliest point where you have an`android.content.Context` that lives for the entire app lifecycle.*

2. Configure and start UXCam recording in Launcher Activity

```kotlin
// app/src/main/java/com/example/MyApp.kt
// import library
import com.uxcam.UXCam;
import com.uxcam.datamodel.UXConfig;
```
```java
import com.uxcam.UXCam;
import com.uxcam.datamodel.UXConfig;
```

<br />

```java Kotlin
// app/src/main/java/com/example/MyApp.kt
class MyApp : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        val builder = UXConfig.Builder(BuildConfig.UXCAM_KEY)
            .enableAutomaticScreenNameTagging(true)   // optional tweaks
            
        
        // Enable verbose integration logging only in debug builds
				if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
        	builder.enableIntegrationLogging(true);
				}

        UXCam.startWithConfiguration(config.build())
    }
}
```
```coffeescript Java
UXConfig config = new UXConfig.Builder("yourAppKey").build();
```

> 👍 As Simple As That!
>
> This will complete the integration process.\
> Your session will be shown on the dashboard within a few seconds after the app goes in the background.
>
> We recommend that after you've set this up and have reviewed some sessions from your tests, get to the customisation features UXCam offers, let's go to the next steps!

## Next Steps ➡️

You've successfully integrated UXCam and sent some sessions, great job! 🎉  But there's so much more you can do. Now, let's go further into setting things up.
