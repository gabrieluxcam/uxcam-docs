If you haven't done so, you can sign up to a free Trial of UXCam [here](https://app.uxcam.com/signup).

Once you've got your account set up, now let's make sure your Android app is equipped with the insights that UXCam can provide.

The UXCam Integration in your Android app consists of 5 simple steps and can be completed in a matter of 1-2 hours. We recommend you use our AI recommendations, which can help you speed up the process significantly Afterwards you will be able to get a holistic, AI powered view of your users' experience through Product Analytics and Engineering Analytics enriched with Session Replay.

1. **Initialise the UXCam SDK in your app to record your first session** - 10 min
2. **Occlude sensitive information.** - 10min with AI - 1h without AI - [add link to next page](link.to.next.page)
3. **Review and setup tagging of screens** - 20min with AI - 2h without AI
4. ***\[Optional]* Instrumentation**
   1. **Tag key events in your app** - 20min with AI - 2h without AI
   2. **Set user IDs and properties** - 10min with AI - 10min without AI
5. **QA and production release**

We recommend you follow these steps before releasing your app with UXCam into production to get the most value out of UXCam, but you can also skip the optional steps and come back to them later.
