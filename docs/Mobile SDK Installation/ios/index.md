> üöß Note for SwiftUI developers:

> If you're working with SwiftUI, you may add the dedicated SwiftUI SDK instead of the regular iOS one, you can check the initial setup [here](https://developer.uxcam.com/docs/swiftui#/).

## Step 1: Get your App Key

### 1.1: Find your app key

If you don't already have it, find it in App Settings -> App Key on your <a href="https://app.uxcam.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UXCam Dashboard</a>.

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/5879b95c4dd8fb37220bdafe37a126498ca203c86da7fecbffb2dcd2fb241b47-image.png" />

<GitHubCallout type="important">**Create separate keys for debug/production.** Keep your data clean, no need to mix test actions with real user insights!</GitHubCallout>

### 1.2: Keep it out of source control:

Put the key in an ignored `.xcconfig` file or pass it in as an environment variable from your CI, then reference it via a build-setting placeholder (e.g. `$(UXCAM_APP_KEY)`) so the value is injected at compile-time and never hard-coded in source.

## Quick Start: Only a Couple of Lines of Code

<GitHubReleaseBadge owner="uxcam" repo="uxcam-ios-sdk" />

Let's get you started with the basics. With just a few lines of code, you'll be on your way to capturing user sessions in your test app.

### Adding the Dependencies

#### Cocoapods

* Add UXCam to your `Podfile`:

`pod 'UXCam'`

* Run <code>pod install</code> in the project directory to download dependency.

<Terminal>
  {`
                                                                                      $ pod install
                                                                                    `}
</Terminal>

#### Swift Package Manager

* If you prefer Swift Package Manager, you can add UXCam using the following URL:

`https://github.com/uxcam/uxcam-ios-sdk`

Specify the exact version to ensure compatibility.

## Initializing UXCam

1. Imports:

```coffeescript Swift
import UXCam
```

2. Configuration

Add the following initialisation to `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` in your `AppDelegate`:

```swift
let configuration = UXCamConfiguration(appKey: "YOUR_APP_KEY")
```

> Replace "YourAppKey" with the app key available on your UXCam dashboard.

3. Then, start the SDK with your configuration object

```swift
import UXCam

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    let config = UXCamConfiguration(appKey: "YOUR_APP_KEY")

    UXCam.optIntoSchematicRecordings()

    #if DEBUG
    // üîç Enable verbose integration logs in Debug builds only
    config.enableIntegrationLogging = true
    #endif

    UXCam.start(with: config)
    return true
}
```

***

## Available Configuration Options:

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableAutomaticScreenNameTagging</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Used to disable automatic screen tagging if manual tagging of the screens will be done, default is true</em>
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableAdvancedGestureRecognition</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Control the gesture recognizers used by UXCam. Set TRUE to enable the full range of gesture recognizers (the default) or FALSE to limit it to basic gestures.</em>
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableCrashHandling:</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Crash handling is enabled by default, to let you capture all the sessions with crashes and see the corresponding crash logs.</em>
</p>

## Build & Test

Run the app on a simulator or device, navigate a few screens, then send it to the background. Your first session replay will appear on the UXCam dashboard within seconds.

> üëç As Simple As That!
>
> This will complete the integration process.\
> Your session will be shown on the dashboard within a few seconds after the app goes in the background.
>
> We recommend that after you've set this up and have reviewed some sessions from your tests, get to the customisation features UXCam offers, let's go to the next steps!
