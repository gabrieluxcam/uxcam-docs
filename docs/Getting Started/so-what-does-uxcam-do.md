# Getting Started with UXCam 🚀

Welcome to UXCam! This is where you’ll unlock powerful insights into how users interact with your mobile app and website. Integrating UXCam gives you a comprehensive toolkit that fuels product growth and optimization through **Session Replays**, **Heatmaps**, **User Analytics**, and more.

With UXCam, you'll be able to capture the real story of user experiences and make better, data-driven decisions about your product’s usability.

> **Fun Fact:** UXCam relies on session recording to give you the best insight into your users actions. Each open-and-close is counted as one "session" in UXCam terms.

## Basic Concepts 📘

Before diving in, let’s breeze through some core concepts:

### Session

A **session** is the window of time when a user interacts with your app, starting when they open it and ending when it goes to the background. Each session tells a unique story of how the user interacts, which screens they visit, and more.

### Screen

**Screens** are the individual pages or views a user navigates through in your app. Tracking these helps reveal user journeys and which parts of your app are most engaging.

### Custom Event

An **event** is a specific action a user takes, like tapping a button or completing a form. Events help you understand how users engage with different features and parts of your app.

### Custom User Property

**User properties** are details about each user, like device type or app version. These properties help segment users for deeper insights into usage patterns and preferences.

## Your App Key 🔑

To start tracking, each UXCam account needs an **App Key** for both test and production environments. This keeps your data clean and actionable – no need to mix test actions with real user insights!

### Finding Your App Key

1. **Log In** to the UXCam dashboard and ensure you have both a test and production environment. If not, create a new app specifically for testing.
2. **Locate the App Key**: If you’re setting up a new app, you’ll see the App Key listed in the **App Settings**. For an existing app, click the app name in the top-left corner > **App Settings** to find it.
3. **Invite Your Team**: If others need access, don’t forget to add them! Here’s how to [add team members](https://help.uxcam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036092012-Manage-your-team).

> **Pro Tip:** Keep your test data separate from your production data to ensure clean, actionable insights!
