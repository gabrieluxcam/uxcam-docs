# âœ¨ Why UXCam?

UXCam turns every mobile moment into **actionable insight**: watch session replays, surface rageâ€‘taps and UI freezes, measure funnels and retention â€” and then jump straight to the line of code that crashed. All of this works **outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box across the entire mobile tech stack** you already ship with.

## What makes UXCam different?

## What makes UXCam different?

| Pillar | How it helps you ship better apps |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **Engineering Analytics**<br/>Crashes Â· ANRs Â· Handled Exceptions Â· Rage-taps Â· Unresponsive Gestures | Get instant alerts for any stability issue, quantify its user-impact, and ship with confidence that UXCam will surface new regressions the moment they happen. |
| **Debugging Capabilities**<br/>Session Replay Â· Stack Traces Â· In-replay Logs | Jump straight from an error card to the exact second in the replay, view device logs, and reproduce complex bugs without asking users for screenshots. |
| **360Â° Product Insights**<br/>Heat-maps Â· Funnels Â· Retention Cohorts | See every gesture and context-click, discover drop-offs, and validate design changes with real behavioural data. |
| **Privacy-first by design** | Client-side PII masking APIs (blur, overlay, sensitive view) satisfy GDPR & CCPA out of the gate. |
| **Wide platform coverage** | One vendor for every mobile framework â€“ native, cross-platform and web. |
