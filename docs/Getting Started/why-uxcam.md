# âœ¨ Why UXCam?

UXCam turns every mobile moment into **actionable insight**: watch session replays, surface rageâ€‘taps and UI freezes, measure funnels and retention â€” and then jump straight to the line of code that crashed. All of this works **outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box across the entire mobile tech stack** you already ship with.

## What makes UXCam different?

| Pillar | How it helps you ship better apps |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **360Â° Experience Analytics**<br/>Session replay Â· Heatâ€‘maps Â· Funnels Â· Cohorts | See every gesture and contextâ€‘click, quantify dropâ€‘offs and iterate with confidence. |
| **Automatic Issue Analytics**<br/>Crashes Â· ANRs Â· UI Freezes | Stackâ€‘trace **plus** replay in one placeÂ â€“ no second SDK required. |
| **Privacyâ€‘first by design** | Clientâ€‘side PII masking APIs (blur, overlay, sensitive view) satisfy GDPR & CCPA out of the gate. |
| **Developerâ€‘grade debugging** | Inâ€‘replay Logcat, network breadcrumbs and rageâ€‘tap pins cut ticket triage time in half. |
| **Wide platform coverage** | One vendor for every mobile frameworkÂ â€“ native, crossâ€‘platform and web. |
