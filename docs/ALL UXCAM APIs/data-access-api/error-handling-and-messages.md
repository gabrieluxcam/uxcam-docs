## Rate Limiting



**[status code: 429]\:**

This means you've made frequent calls to an API that exceeded the call rate limit. UXCam has implemented the following **rate limit**.

- A maximum of five concurrent requests per second
- A maximum of 500 requests per hour
- A Total number of 500 records can be fetched on a single request.

If any of the above-mentioned conditions are met regarding the rate limit, then APIs will start to throw a 429 status code. **This limit will only be reset every 24 hours.**

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To minimise rate-limiting errors, consider combining multiple filters, groupings, and aggregations into a single request to make multiple queries.
