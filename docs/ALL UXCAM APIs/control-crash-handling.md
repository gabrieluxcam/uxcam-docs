Crash handling is enabled by default, to let you capture all the sessions with crashes and see the corresponding crash logs. We provide this option to disable crash handling within UXCam as having two crash reporters at the same time is not recommended since they are very sensitive. 

By default, UXCam automatically detects crashes and ANRs to let you capture all the sessions with crashes and see the corresponding crash logs. You can also enable/disable crash handling, report non-fatal (handled) exceptions and events.

### Control Crash Handling Events

**If you want to disable UXCam from capturing sessions with crashes**, you will need to call this API** before startWithKey.**

UXCam.disableCrashHandling(_ disabled: Bool)
```
```java Android
UXCam.disableCrashHandling(bool disabled)
```
```csharp Xamarin

```
```javascript React Native
