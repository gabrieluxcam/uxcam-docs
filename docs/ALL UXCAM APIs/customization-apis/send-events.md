You can send events and events' properties to UXCam to gather more insights about your users' behavior. It will help you to:â€¨â€¨

* Create more granular funnels thanks to the combination of Events and Screens.
* Follow your user journey closely by analyzing all the relevant steps.
* Easily identify errors in your user journey or conversion process.
* Track each step of your registration process to easily identify drop-offs.
* Measure and analyze the adoption of new features.

E.g You have an app to book movie tickets. Youâ€™re sending the Event â€˜ticket\_booked,â€™  you can then attach several properties to the event to provide more context to that event, such as: â€˜Movie\_Categoryâ€™, â€˜Movie\_Nameâ€™, â€˜Movie\_Timeâ€™, â€˜Quantityâ€™, â€˜Priceâ€™, etc. 

Need some inspiration? [Check this article to find some Events ideas â†’](https://help.uxcam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043593691)

All the events will be attached to the respective sessions and users; therefore, you can easily use filters to find sessions or users that triggered a specific event. Whatâ€™s more, you can analyze your events with Event Analytics or use them to build funnels.

### Log Events

Log an event into the timeline along with custom properties

```swift iOS
logEvent(_ eventName: String)
logEvent(_ eventName: String, withProperties properties: [String: Any]?)
    
//Example
UXCam.logEvent("purchased")
UXCam.logEvent("purchased",withProperties: [
    "size": 7,
    "brand": "Nike"
])
```
```java Android
logEvent(String eventName)
logEvent(String eventName, Map properties)
logEvent(String eventName, JSONObject properties)

//Example
UXCam.logEvent("purchased");
//With properties
final Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String!, Any!>();
properties.put("size", "7");
properties.put("brand", "Nike");
UXCam.logEvent("purchased", properties);
```
```javascript React Native
RNUxcam.logEvent: (eventName: string, properties?: any) => void

//Example
RNUxcam.logEvent("purchased");
RNUxcam.logEvent("purchased", {
  "size": 7,
  "brand": "Nike"
});
```
```javascript Flutter
logEvent(String eventName)
logEventWithProperties(String eventName, Map<String, dynamic> properties)

//Example
FlutterUxcam.logEvent("purchased");
FlutterUxcam.logEventWithProperties("purchased", {
    "size": 7,
    "brand": "Nike"
});
```
```csharp Xamarin
void UXCam.LogEvent(string eventName)
void UXCam.LogEvent(string eventName, JSONObject properties) //Android
void UXCam.LogEvent(string eventName, NSObject properties) //iOS
```
```javascript Cordova
UXCam.logEvent: (eventName: string) => void
UXCam.logEventWithProperties: (eventName: string, properties: any) => void

//Example
UXCam.logEvent("purchased")
UXCam.logEventWithProperties("purchased", {
    "size": 7,
    "brand": "Nike"
});
```

> **eventName**: A tag to attach to the session recording at the current time\
> **properties**: (Optional) A Dictionary of properties to associate with this event. Only number and string property types are supported.

> ðŸ“˜ Tips on Sending Dates as Event Properties:
>
> In terms of the date formats, there are many options that will work, but generally we would recommend to use the UTC time format (â€˜YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZâ€™) or either of the following options:\
> â€˜YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SSâ€™\
> â€˜YYYY/MM/DD HH-MM-SSâ€™\
> â€˜YYYY-MM-DDâ€™\
> â€˜YYYY/MM/DDâ€™\
> â€˜YYYYâ€™.\
> The separators you use donâ€™t matter as long as they are consistent. For instance if you compare â€˜YYYY/MMâ€™  to â€˜YYYY-MMâ€™ you will get sensible results.\
> Alternatively, you can just attach the Unix time (seconds since 1970), and then use simple integer comparison [https://www.utctime.net/utc-timestamp](https://www.utctime.net/utc-timestamp) which will work already.

### Things to Consider

* If you pass more than the limit 20 properties for a single event, instead, an event called \_UXCam\_Overload will appear mentioning the limit has been exceeded for that event.
