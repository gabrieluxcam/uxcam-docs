> üöß Note for SwiftUI developers:

> If you're working with SwiftUI, you may add the dedicated SwiftUI SDK instead of the regular iOS one, you can check the initial setup [here](https://developer.uxcam.com/v1.1/docs/swiftui).

# What Does a Successful Integration Look Like?

With a solid integration, you‚Äôll have a complete picture of how users interact with your app. From screen journeys and user behaviors to session replays and user properties, you‚Äôll be able to understand and enhance every aspect of your product‚Äôs user experience. Follow along with this quick guide, and you‚Äôll be up and running in no time.

## Quick Start: Only a Couple of Lines of Code

<GitHubReleaseBadge owner="uxcam" repo="uxcam-ios-sdk" />

Let's get you started with the basics. With just a few lines of code, you'll be on your way to capturing user sessions in your test app.

### Adding the Dependencies

#### Cocoapods

* Add UXCam to your `Podfile`:

`pod 'UXCam'`

* Run <code>pod install</code> in the project directory to download dependency.

<Terminal>
  {`
          $ pod install
        `}
</Terminal>

#### Swift Package Manager

* If you prefer Swift Package Manager, you can add UXCam using the following URL:

`https://github.com/uxcam/uxcam-ios-sdk`

Specify the exact version to ensure compatibility.

## Initializing UXCam

1. Imports:

```coffeescript Swift
import UXCam
```

2. Configuration

Add the following initialisation to `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` in your `AppDelegate`:

```swift
let configuration = UXCamConfiguration(appKey: "YourAppKey")
```

> Replace "YourAppKey" with the app key available on your UXCam dashboard.

3. Then, start the SDK with your configuration object

```swift
UXCam.optIntoSchematicRecordings()
UXCam.start(with: configuration)
```

***

## Available Configuration Options:

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableAutomaticScreenNameTagging</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Used to disable automatic screen tagging if manual tagging of the screens will be done, default is true</em>
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableAdvancedGestureRecognition</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Control the gesture recognizers used by UXCam. Set TRUE to enable the full range of gesture recognizers (the default) or FALSE to limit it to basic gestures.</em>
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "18px" }}>
  <code class="language-java">enableCrashHandling:</code>

  <br />

  <em style={{ fontSize: "13px" }}>Crash handling is enabled by default, to let you capture all the sessions with crashes and see the corresponding crash logs.</em>
</p>

> üëç As Simple As That!
>
> This will complete the integration process.\
> Your session will be shown on the dashboard within a few seconds after the app goes in the background.
>
> We recommend that after you've set this up and have reviewed some sessions from your tests, get to the customisation features UXCam offers, let's go to the next steps!
