UXCam automatically records an **Install ID** for every fresh install.\
That’s handy, but:

* A user who *re‑installs* gets a **new** Install ID → journey is split.
* A user who signs‑in on **multiple devices** generates one Install ID per device.
* Support can’t search the dashboard for “user‑42” if you never tell UXCam who that is.

Fixing this is a one‑liner: **set the User ID as soon as you know it** (login, sign‑up, or deep‑link token).

## When to call `setUserIdentity`

| Timing                                             | Why it works                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Immediately after successful login / sign‑up**   | You have a backend‑verified ID and can safely map it to the Install ID.                                                        |
| **On every app launch** (optional but recommended) | Makes sure the ID is set even if the user logs in via push‑token or is already authenticated. The call is cheap and debounced. |

> **One call per session is fine.** Once UXCam links Install ID ↔︎ User ID, it persists on the device; extra calls simply noop.

### Code snippet

```java
// After your auth flow returns success
String uid = authResult.getUserId();      // e.g. "user_42"
UXCam.setUserIdentity(uid);
```
```kotlin
UXCam.setUserIdentity(authResult.userId)
```

## Attach custom user properties

User properties let you segment funnels and heat‑maps by meaningful traits—plan, cohort, geography, etc.\
You can store **up to 100** key‑value pairs per user.

```java
UXCam.setUserProperty("plan", "pro");
UXCam.setUserProperty("signup_source", "google_ads");
UXCam.setUserProperty("nps_score", "9");
```

| Best‑practice                               | Reason                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use stable, non‑PII values** (IDs, enums) | Avoids GDPR headaches. You can always look up an email in your own DB.    |
| **Snake\_case keys**                        | Consistent naming prevents duplicates (`planType` vs `plan_type`).        |
| **Update only when value changes**          | The SDK overwrites the previous value; no need to resend unchanged props. |

***

## Verify Your Work

1. Log in with a test account on a debug build.
2. Wait for the session to upload.
3. In the Dashboard, go to **Users → Search** and type your test *User ID*.
4. Confirm you see **one merged user** with sessions from all devices and reinstalls.

If the user does **not** appear:

* Check Logcat—`UXCam: setUserIdentity called with …` should be logged once.
* Ensure the call runs **after** `UXCam.startWithConfiguration()`.
* Verify the ID is **not null / empty** (empty strings are ignored).

## Troubleshooting cheat‑sheet

| Issue                           | Possible cause                                        | Fix                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two records for the same user   | Different casing (`User42` vs `user42`)               | Normalise to lower‑case before calling.                 |
| User disappears after reinstall | `setUserIdentity` only called on first install        | Call it every app launch or after silent token refresh. |
| Support can’t find user         | You passed PII instead of UID and later obfuscated it | Store UID in ticket system and share with Support.      |
| Property not visible            | Sent as `int` but dashboard shows strings             | Cast all numeric props to strings.                      |

## 5 QA checklist

* [ ] `UXCam.setUserIdentity()` fires **once per session** after login.
* [ ] Dashboard search returns the user across reinstalls / devices.
* [ ] Important properties (`plan`, `signup_source`, etc.) show under **User Profile**.
* [ ] No emails or phone numbers stored unless DPA is signed.
* [ ] Re‑install app → first session still linked after login.

***

### Next steps

* **Events** – tag key actions (e.g. upgrade\_clicked).
* **Push UXCam URL into your support tool** – deep‑link to the user’s session list from Zendesk or Intercom.
