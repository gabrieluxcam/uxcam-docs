### Overview

Defining pages helps you simplify your analytics by grouping similar URLs under consistent and meaningful names. This ensures cleaner data, easier reporting, and better insights across web and mobile platforms.

**With page definitions, you can:**

* Group related URLs under a single page or screen name (e.g., ‚ÄúProduct Page‚Äù).
* Extract and store dynamic values (like product name or category) as properties.
* Standardise naming conventions for pages and screens.
* Tag pages using URL fragments or parameters.

<br />

### Benefits of Defining Pages

* **Cleaner, More Actionable Data**\
  Eliminate clutter by treating dynamic values (e.g., IDs) as properties rather than separate pages.
* **Standardized Reporting**\
  Aggregate similar pages (e.g., all product pages) under one name for clearer, more concise analytics.
* **Improved Filtering and Segmentation**\
  Filter sessions by saved properties like product category or name to discover specific insights.
* **Consistent Cross-Platform Tracking**\
  Align naming across web and mobile to maintain structured analytics.
* **Smarter Alerts and Insights**\
  Grouping pages enables more accurate anomaly detection and performance monitoring.

> üëç **Tip**
>
> Always define your pages if your URLs contain dynamic path parameters or fragments.

> üìò **Note**
>
> If screen names are not manually defined, UXCam defaults to displaying the URL path as the screen name.

## **Accessing the Page Definition Section**

Without any dev dependency, with simple and intuitive UI, immediate changes and rule testing capabilities.

1. Clicking on the web app you created from the left side bar and opening the 'App setting'
2. Navigating to the 'Page definition' tab

## **Grouping Similar Content (Dynamic IDs in URLs)**

To ensure consistent tracking and analysis, it‚Äôs important to group URLs with dynamic path parameters‚Äîlike user or product IDs‚Äîunder a single, logical page name. This helps avoid treating every variation as a separate page and simplifies data reporting.

<br />

> Example: On Spotify, each artist has a unique ID represented in the URL
>
> * /artist/**5K79FLRUCSysQnVESLcTdb**
> * /artist/**1HY2Jd0NmPuamShAr6KMms**
>
> Even though the artist ID changes, these are all versions of the same **Artist Page**, and should not be considered separate pages.

<br />

To group URLs that include dynamic path parameters under a single page, follow these steps:

1. Choose a URL that follows the structure of the pages you want to group.
2. Select the Dynamic Part
   1. Identify the changing section (e.g. artist ID: 1HY2Jd0NmPuamShAr6KMms).
   2. Decide whether to name it and save it as a **property** (e.g. \{artist-Id} so you can filter later) or ignore it (replace it with a wildcard \* )
3. Define the Page Name (e.g. Artist Page)
4. Review & Test the Rule
   1. Confirm the pattern and test it with different URL variations.

<br />

## **Tagging Fragments as distinct pages**

* Enter the URL that represents the page structure you want to define.
* Select the checkbox to ensure the Fragment is extracted from the URL
* Define the Page Name
* Confirm the pattern and test it with different URL variations.

## **Renaming Pages for Cleaner Reports**

If you want to replace long URLs with short, customized page names for clearer reporting, follow these steps:

1. **Enter a URL** that follows the structure of the page you want to define.
2. **Define a clear page name** that aligns with your naming conventions.

> In the example below, you can see [https://www.spotify.com/join/](https://www.spotify.com/join/) was renamed -> Join page

<br />

## **Cleaning pages name**

If your URLs contain **fragments**, and **dynamic path parameters**, and you also want a clean page name, you can solve them all at once using Page Definition.

Follow these steps:

1. Enter a URL that follows the structure of the page you want to define.
2. Select my URL contains fragments
3. Select the dynamic part  (e.g. \{RestaurantName}  and optionally save it as a property.
4. Define a meaningful name for your screen/page  (e.g. ‚ÄúRestaurant Choose items‚Äù).
5. Review and test the rule to ensure it applies correctly.

<br />

## **Assigning multiple rules**

When creating rules, you can assign the same 'page name' to multiple rules, these will be processed and displayed by UXCam as a single screen.

This can also be useful in case your URLs change but you want to keep your data consistent.

E.g. if you used to have `domain.com/products/product-name` defined as Products Page and now you have `domain.com/category/products/product-name `you can name it as Products Page and archive your previous rule.

üí° If you have dynamic URLs that share the same URL structure e.g. `domain.com/{dynamic-category-id} `vs `domain.com/{dynamic-product-id}.` Read the guides below:
