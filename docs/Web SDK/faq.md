## Resolving CORS Issues for UXCam Session Replays

If youâ€™re noticing missing fonts, broken icons, or layout issues in UXCam session replays, itâ€™s likely due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

<br />

**What is CORS?**

CORS is a browser security mechanism that blocks resources (like fonts, images, or stylesheets) from loading if theyâ€™re not explicitly allowed to be accessed from another domain. This is meant to prevent unauthorized cross-site access.

<br />

**Why It Happens in UXCam?**

During session replay, your website is loaded inside a different domain ([https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com)) to simulate the user experience. If your assets are restricted to load only from your own domain, browsers may block them during playback.

<br />

**Typical browser console error:**

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://yourdomain.com/assets/file
```

This means the asset couldnâ€™t load because it wasnâ€™t allowed to be accessed from app.uxcam.com.

<br />

**How It Affects Replays**

Without proper CORS configuration:\
â€¢	Fonts may not render (showing empty boxes)
â€¢	Images and styles may not appear
â€¢	Layouts can break

<br />

## How to fix it?

To ensure all assets load correctly in session replays

âœ… **1. Enable CORS on your server**\
Update your serverâ€™s headers to allow requests from the replay domain:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com)

If needed, also include:\
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Avoid using \* for Access-Control-Allow-Origin if your assets require credentials (like cookies).

âœ… 2. Check Any Third-Party or CDN Assets\
If you're hosting fonts, images, or styles via a CDN or third-party service, make sure they also allow cross-origin requests from app.uxcam.com.

âœ… 3. (Optional) Use a Proxy Server\
If you canâ€™t change the CORS settings on the asset server, another approach is to serve those assets through your own server or a proxy that adds the required CORS headers.

### How to Allow UXCam to Access Your Assets via CORS

You must configure your server or cloud storage to include this CORS rule:

```Text http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.uxcam.com
```

<br />

### If Your Assets Are Hosted on AWS S3

For Amazon S3 buckets, update the CORS configuration:

1. Go to AWS S3 Console.
2. Navigate to Permissions > CORS Configuration.
3. Add this JSON rule

```Text JSON
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["https://app.uxcam.com"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

4. Save changes and test if styles now load in UXCam replays.

<br />

### If Your Assets Are Hosted on a Custom Web Server

If you host assets on your own web server (Apache or Node.js), modify the server settings:

âœ” For Apache (.htaccess file)

```Text Apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://app.uxcam.com"
</IfModule>
```

âœ” For Express.js (Node.js)

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');  
app.use(cors({ origin: "<https://app.uxcam.com"> }));
```
