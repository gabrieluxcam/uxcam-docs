## Resolving CORS Issues for UXCam Session Replays

If you‚Äôre noticing missing fonts, broken icons, or layout issues in UXCam session replays, it‚Äôs likely due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

<br />

**What is CORS?**

CORS is a browser security mechanism that blocks resources (like fonts, images, or stylesheets) from loading if they‚Äôre not explicitly allowed to be accessed from another domain. This is meant to prevent unauthorized cross-site access.

<br />

**Why It Happens in UXCam**

During session replay, your website is loaded inside a different domain ([https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com)) to simulate the user experience. If your assets are restricted to load only from your own domain, browsers may block them during playback.

<br />

If you're seeing missing fonts, broken icons, or layout issues in your session replays, it‚Äôs likely due to a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue.

CORS is a browser security feature that restricts how resources can be shared between websites. It‚Äôs designed to protect users by preventing one site from accessing sensitive content from another without permission.

<br />

**What‚Äôs causing this issue?**\
During session replay, your website is loaded from a different domain ‚Äî app.uxcam.com ‚Äî so we can show you what the user experienced. But if your fonts, images, or styles are only allowed to load from your own domain, the browser may block them when the session is replayed.

You might see errors like this in your browser's console:

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at [https://yourdomain.com/assets/something](https://yourdomain.com/assets/something)

This means the asset couldn‚Äôt load because it wasn‚Äôt allowed to be accessed from app.uxcam.com.

<br />

**How does it affect session replays?**

If your website doesn‚Äôt explicitly allow assets to be loaded from app.uxcam.com, fonts may appear as empty boxes, images may not display, and some styles may break during playback.

<br />

## How to fix it?

To ensure all assets load correctly in session replays

‚úÖ **1. Enable CORS on your server**\
Update your server‚Äôs headers to allow requests from the replay domain:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com)

If needed, also include:\
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Avoid using \* for Access-Control-Allow-Origin if your assets require credentials (like cookies).

‚úÖ 2. Check Any Third-Party or CDN Assets\
If you're hosting fonts, images, or styles via a CDN or third-party service, make sure they also allow cross-origin requests from app.uxcam.com.

‚úÖ 3. (Optional) Use a Proxy Server\
If you can‚Äôt change the CORS settings on the asset server, another approach is to serve those assets through your own server or a proxy that adds the required CORS headers.

### How to Allow UXCam to Access Your Assets via CORS

You must configure your server or cloud storage to include this CORS rule:

```Text http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.uxcam.com
```

<br />

### If Your Assets Are Hosted on AWS S3

For Amazon S3 buckets, update the CORS configuration:

1. Go to AWS S3 Console.
2. Navigate to Permissions > CORS Configuration.
3. Add this JSON rule

```Text JSON
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["https://app.uxcam.com"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

4. Save changes and test if styles now load in UXCam replays.

<br />

### If Your Assets Are Hosted on a Custom Web Server

If you host assets on your own web server (Apache or Node.js), modify the server settings:

‚úî For Apache (.htaccess file)

```Text Apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://app.uxcam.com"
</IfModule>
```

‚úî For Express.js (Node.js)

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');  
app.use(cors({ origin: "<https://app.uxcam.com"> }));
```
