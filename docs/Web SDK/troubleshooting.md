## Resolving CORS Issues for UXCam Session Replays

If youâ€™re noticing missing fonts, broken icons, or layout issues in UXCam session replays, itâ€™s likely due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

<br />

**What is CORS?**

CORS is a browser security mechanism that blocks resources (like fonts, images, or stylesheets) from loading if theyâ€™re not explicitly allowed to be accessed from another domain. This is meant to prevent unauthorized cross-site access.

<br />

**Why It Happens in UXCam?**

During session replay, your website is loaded inside a different domain ([https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com)) to simulate the user experience. If your assets are restricted to load only from your own domain, browsers may block them during playback.

<br />

**Typical browser console error**

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://yourdomain.com/assets/file
```

This means the asset couldnâ€™t load because it wasnâ€™t allowed to be accessed from app.uxcam.com.

<br />

**How It Affects Replays**

Without proper CORS configuration:\
â€¢	Fonts may not render (showing empty boxes)
â€¢	Images and styles may not appear
â€¢	Layouts can break

<br />

## How to fix it?

<br />

**1. Enable CORS on your server**\
Set the following header to allow asset access from UXCam:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.uxcam.com
```

If your assets require credentials (like cookies), also include:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Avoid using \* for Access-Control-Allow-Origin if your assets require credentials (like cookies).

<br />

**2. Update Third-Party or CDN Asset Settings**\
Ensure any CDN or external services hosting your fonts, images, or styles also permit access from [https://app.uxcam.com](https://app.uxcam.com).

<br />

**3. Use a Proxy Server (Optional)**\
If CORS settings canâ€™t be changed on the asset server, you can proxy the assets through your own server and attach the necessary headers.

## CORS Setup Examples

<br />

### Using AWS S3

For Amazon S3 buckets, update the CORS configuration:

1. Open your AWS S3 Console
2. Navigate to: Permissions > CORS Configuration
3. Add the following JSON:

```Text JSON
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["https://app.uxcam.com"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

4. Save and verify if assets now load in replays.

<br />

### Using a Custom Web Server

In case you host assets on your own web server (Apache or Node.js), modify the server settings:

**For Apache (.htaccess file)**

```Text Apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://app.uxcam.com"
</IfModule>
```

**Node.js (Express)**

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');  
app.use(cors({ origin: "<https://app.uxcam.com"> }));
```
